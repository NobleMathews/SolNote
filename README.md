### Try it out!

## üí° Inspiration
- We wanted to harness the power of **Blockchain technology** to help users **share notes** with others anonymously that can be accessed by anyone in the world
- Use decentralization to enable ease of shareability with data being in our own control. Data gone once we choose to delete and take off blockchain
- The users can also see what others have written without knowing other details of the person who shared it. 
- This ensures anyone can access the notes but cannot corrupt them.

## üìù What it does
- SolNote is a **Blockchain-based note-taking Dapp** based on **Solana Blockchain**
- The users can link popular wallets of Solana to write, edit and delete snippets and share them anonymously with the help of Blockchain using a link
- Currently we have a 500 character limit per note
- Once we reach the limit, the color changes to red to give a warning
- As long as the user has enough Sol, they can keep adding notes
- The time of creation of the note will also be recorded
- As long as the file is available on the network, it will be available to anyone in the world with the link
- Snippets can be shared securely and anonymously using SolNote
- It is a decentralized, secure, verified, and anonymous file-sharing system based on the foundations of blockchain technology

## üî• How we built it
- Ideated on what we can build using Solana Blockchain that solves a real-world problem
- Planned on how we can turn our idea into a project
- Made a timeline on how we can divide complete it in a short time
- Decided on which languages and frameworks to use for the project
- Start coding!
- We tested it out using **Phantom**
- Solved the challenges we faced
- Yay! Finally we had **SolNote** working.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges we ran into

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Got familiar with the Solana Blockchain and applied it to make a project in a short time
- Created something from nothing. We both started from scratch, but ended up making it!
- Challenged our brain to find innovative solutions to solve the challenges
- Enjoyed creative and collaborative week learning a lot of new things together
- Overall, it was a fantastic experience!

## üìñ What we learned
- Got familiar with the Solana Blockchain
- Best practices of using tools like Git & GitHub
- The best practices of pair programming on a project
- How to plan & collaborate to complete a task in a short period of time
- Attention to details
- How to quickly learn a new skill

## üìå What's next
- Add a feature for allowing users to upload **password protected private notes**
- Add a **Pagination feature** as we scale up so that we only query what we require server side. Currently, we are not facing any issues as we are not dealing with large corpus
- Support for variable sized content and self-terminating notes. Based on a rent system, we can assign only enough rent to an account such that it deletes itself once a set time is reached when it will become unable to pay the rent
- Support for more varied kinds of content like video, images, voice features and other multimedia
- Add features for **collaboration** and **shared notes**
